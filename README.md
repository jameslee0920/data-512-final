# OK Boomer, Are We Really Different?: <br>Comparing the Time Use of Americans from the Baby Boomer Generation to GenZ.  

## Motivation
We experience a type of fencing across generations in Social Media.  The slang phrase "Ok, Boomer" rose over recent years.  By definition from [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/ok-boomer/?itm_source=parsely-api), Ok Boomer is a viral internet slang phrase used, often in a humorous or ironic manner, to call out or dismiss out-of-touch or closed-minded opinions associated with the baby boomer generation and older people more generally.  This analysis will attempt seek whether the experiences in time use are different across generations, and also determine if there are other factors alongside generations responsible for widening this perceived gap.  

# Data Selected for Analysis
Data was collected from the [American Time Use Survey](https://www.bls.gov/tus/datafiles-0319.htm) from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).  More information regarding the American Time Use Survey can be found [here](https://www.bls.gov/tus/atususersguide.pdf).  
The data from BLS is in the public domain and is free to use without specific permission. [(Link)](https://www.bls.gov/bls/linksite.htm)
This data is suitable in that it has anonymized survey participants and we can obtain the correct demographics and adjust age by the year of survey to obtain working / retiring (ages 65+) age populations.  
The generations will be categorized by definition from (Pew Research)[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/].
